### Description:
This work analyses reef community composition in terms of fish and benthic functional groups to define distinct reef regimes. Analyses include defining regimes, and studying patterns among and within regimes. Additionally, data from timeseries are used to examine patterns of transitions among regimes, as well as the relationship between regime transitions and local and global drivers of reef change.

### Contents:
#### Scripts:
* **Hawaii_reef_regimes.Rmd:** Rmarkdown script that encompasses all of the analyses in the accompanying publication and supplemental material

#### Data:
* **data/Hawaii_regimes.csv/:** data on 10 reef variables used to define regimes

* **data/Hawaii_regime_timeseries/:** data on 10 reef variables by year used to understand transitions among regimes

* **data/Hawaii_regime_drivers.csv/:** data on human population density and degree heating weeks used to ivestigate drivers of regime transitions


#### Output:
* **output/:** Directory containing the figures and tables produced by the analysis scripts and presented in the manuscript and the Supplement.
