Hawaii_regime_drivers.csv is a comma-separated file containing data used to understand relationships between regime transitions and local and global drivers. The file includes data on human poupulation density and degree heating weeks for each replicate found in Hawaii_regime_timeseries.csv. Details of the analysis can be found in the accompanying publication. Parties interested in using this data for other purposes are asked to contact Mary Donovan (donovan.maryk@gmail.com).

Columns are:
1- repID_ts - a unique identifier for each of 1279 replicates in Hawaii_regime_timeseries.csv
2- humanpop - human population density with 15km radius
3- dhw - degree heating weeks on November 1, 2015 from NOAA Coral Reef Watch 5km v3 product

Note: geographic coordinates for some replicates have been removed as they were collected via confidentiality agreements with Hawaiian communities. Should this information be important to future uses of the data, please contact Mary Donovan (donovan.maryk@gmail.com).
