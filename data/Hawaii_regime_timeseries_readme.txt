Filename: Hawaii_regime_timeseries.csv
Curated by: M.K. Donovan, donovan.maryk@gmail.com

Hawaii_regime_timeseries.csv is a comma-separated file containing data used to investigate changes in regimes over time. The file includes metadata for 1279 replicates across multiple years, 10 reef community metrics used to define regimes in a cluster analysis, and the geographic location of the replicate. Details of the analysis can be found in the accompanying publication. Parties interested in using this data for other purposes are asked to contact Mary Donovan (donovan.maryk@gmail.com).

Columns are:
1- repID_ts - a unique identifier for each of 1279 replicates
2- Browsers - browser biomass (grams per meter squared)
3- Grazers - grazer biomass (grams per meter squared)
4- Scrapers - scraper biomass (grams per meter squared)
5- Predators - predator biomass (grams per meter squared)
6- SecConsumers - secondary consumer biomass (grams per meter squared)
7- Coral - coral cover (%)
8- Macro - macroalgal cover (%)
9- Other - other benthic cover (%)
10- Turf - turf algal cover (%)
11- CCA - coralline algal cover (%)
12- Latitude - geographic coordinate system WGS 1984
13- Longitude - geographic coordinate system WGS 1984

Note: geographic coordinates for some replicates have been removed as they were collected via confidentiality agreements with Hawaiian communities. Should this information be important to future uses of the data, please contact Mary Donovan (donovan.maryk@gmail.com).
