Filename: Hawaii_regimes.csv
Curated by: M.K. Donovan, donovan.maryk@gmail.com

Hawaii_regimes.csv is a comma-separated file containing data used to define reef regimes for the Hawaii Islands. The file includes metadata for 1027 replicates, 10 reef community metrics used to define regimes in a cluster analysis, and the resulting reef regime. Reef community metrics are averages of individual replicates grouped based on spatial proximity. Details of the analysis can be found in the accompanying publication. Parties interested in using this data for other purposes are asked to contact Mary Donovan (donovan.maryk@gmail.com).

For all columns: missing data are represented by NA

Columns are:
1- replicateID - a unique identifier for each of 1027 replicates
2- Latitude - geographic coordinate system WGS 1984
3- Longitude - geographic coordinate system WGS 1984
4- Island - island name, 1 of 8 main Hawaiian Islands
5- Depth_m - median depth in meters
6- Complexity - measured as slope of slope from LiDAR bathymetry
7- Exposure - dominant cardinal direction of coastline
8- Coral - coral cover (%)
9- Macro - macroalgal cover (%)
10- Other - other benthic cover (%)
11- Turf - turf algal cover (%)
12- CCA - coralline algal cover (%)
13- Browsers - browser biomass (grams per meter squared)
14- Grazers - grazer biomass (grams per meter squared)
15- Scrapers - scraper biomass (grams per meter squared)
16- Predators - predator biomass (grams per meter squared)
17- SecConsumers - secondary consumer biomass (grams per meter squared)
18- regime - regimes 1-5 as defined in accompanying publication

Note: geographic coordinates for some replicates have been removed as they were collected via confidentiality agreements with Hawaiian communities. Should this information be important to future uses of the data, please contact Mary Donovan (donovan.maryk@gmail.com).
